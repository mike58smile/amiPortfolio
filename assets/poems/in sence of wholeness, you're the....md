in sence of wholeness, you're the bliss.
in the unknown and still peace,
that's where worth is met in depths
understood in your heart and haze.

when you don't strain to feel fuller,
you'll get your inner sureness.
also, the flow to get onto your path
of love, your fears and your aim
with no name for this dread
understanding miracles of your self.

pace on which you walk with braveness,
there's not a reason for lunacy,
when you're sure of yourself so deeply
you're growing in your own galaxy.
