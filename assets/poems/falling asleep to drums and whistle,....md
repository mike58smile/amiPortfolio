falling asleep to drums and whistle,
crickets singing and wind
welcoming leasure.
fresh breeze and firefly comes with
the night,
there's a reason you see stars and
make your wishes,
you are that radiating love in a sea
of now.
moons peaking and you have crazy
dreams,
be so dear and say goodbye to your
fears,
shake your body to let old be in
peace,
your heart radiates reflection of
your gifts.
darkness always brightens your
depths,
never ending feeling of the greatest
mess,
becoming the new out of eggs, or
tadpole,
you hear newborn and listen to your
highest notes.
